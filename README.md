Building a table using data stored in a JavaScript array

## Overview of UFO Sightings
This week i was provided with JavaScript data on UFO sightings and was instructed on creating an HTML site that included a table for holding the data with the ability to filter it.

## Results
I was successfuly able to add the data to the table, and to make the project even cooler, I added a the ability to filter the table based on the city, state, shape of anomoly and time. And the cherry on top, I used bootstrap to make the site reallly cool looking!

## Summary
The site that I made was pretty darn sweet. but was slightly limited by the fact that I would need to add data to the JavaScript file manually in order to add new sitings to the table. It would be an even more impressive website had I added a way to pull the data from a spreadsheet, or perhaps even an API?
